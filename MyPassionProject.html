	<p>Brunch is by far the best meal, far superior to dinner or lunch or breakfast. I'm a huge brunch enthusiast because you're allowed to eat a crapload of food without remorse because you're compensating for 2 meals</p>
	<p>It encompasses both lunch and breakfast foods, which is generally really great. You can have eggs and bacon OR a sandwich with eggs and bacon</p>
